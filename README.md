# MachineLearningPuzzle
A puzzle solver program with Machine Learning
This is an AlexNet derived Deep Neural Network that uses the library tflearn to train and test random "pieces" of an image to see if they "fit" together or not. This took mulitple weeks to run and got about ninty percent accuracy on picture piece sizes of about 30 pixels by 30 pixels.  This also has python scripts to cut up pictures!
